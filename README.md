# I Love Money

*I Love Money* is a web application made to ease shared budget management. It keeps track of who bought what, when, and for whom; and helps to settle the bills.

**Note**: This is a modified version of [I Hate Money](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney) only suitable for my needs:

- new project title: I Love Money
- adapted the logo
- removed the french showcase everywhere
- added the project name to the pages title
- removed most of footer links
